# Galleria

A nice gallery to use in full screen in your website. This was to practice a bit more of CSS and JS combined with HTML. Getting better and better! :)

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add animations that go alone without having to tap.
- [ ] Add more customization points and make a separate component from the JS code.
