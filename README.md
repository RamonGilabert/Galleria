# Galleria

![Galleria](https://github.com/RamonGilabert/Galleria/blob/master/resources/Screenshot.png)

A nice gallery to use in full screen in your website. This was to practice a bit more of CSS and JS combined with HTML. Getting better and better! :)

## Roadmap

- [x] Add animations that go alone without having to tap.
- [x] Add more customization points and make a separate component from the JS code.
